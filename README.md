# MerkleTree Written in Rust

## What?

This project involves creating a Merkle Tree from a `Vec<String>`, utilizing `crypto::sha3::Sha3::keccak256()` as the hash function.

In the initial implementation, the aim is to maintain the leaves of all levels as `MerkleTreeDs` (MerkleTreeDataStructure). The `new` operation is straightforward. However, adding or pushing a new leaf and verifying if an element exists in the Merkle tree given the "path" require a more sophisticated algorithm (Merkle Patricia Tree).

To simplify the data structure, instead of using an arrangement based on `Option<Box<Node>>`—where each node contains an item along with left and right nodes—we propose employing a `Vec<String>` to store the initial leaves. The resulting `MerkleTreeVec` structure only holds the initial leaves and the root. One drawback is that recalculating the root needs to be recomputed entirely if a new leaf is added or pushed.

## Why?

The main goal of the project is to practice Rust Programming, understand the MerkleTree data structure and know its potential.

## How?

```sh
cargo run 
```

### Simple usecase

`main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mtree = MerkleTreeDs::new(vec!["D".to_string()]);
    let mtree_vec = MerkleTreeVec::new(vec!["D".to_string()]);
    println!("{mtree}");
    println!("{}", mtree_vec.root);
}
```

Output:

```sh
Merkle Tree:
 root- 5bba9
     left- 6c3fd
        left- None
        right- None
     right- 6c3fd
        left- None
        right- None

```

Here `"D"` is duplicated and we get the following:

```mermaid
flowchart BT;
    D(D) --> left("h(D) = 6c3fd")
    D_copy("D") --> right("h(D) = 6c3fd")

    subgraph "Copy operation"
        direction LR
        D --> D_copy
    end
    root("h(h(D)+h(D)) = 5bba9")
    left --> root
    right --> root
```

```
In the context of a Merkle Tree, duplicating a value when needed typically occurs during tree balancing. When a new leaf is added to the tree and it needs to be hashed with another value to maintain the binary tree structure, but there is no corresponding value to hash with, the existing value is duplicated to serve as the missing hash partner.

Here's how this expansion works in the context of a Merkle Tree:

1. **Balancing the Tree**: When adding a new leaf to the Merkle Tree, it's crucial to maintain a binary tree structure. If the number of leaves is odd, the last leaf needs to be duplicated to maintain balance. This ensures that each leaf has a partner to hash with at each level of the tree.

2. **Hashing Pairs**: In a Merkle Tree, each level consists of hashed pairs of values. When balancing the tree requires duplicating a leaf, the duplicated leaf is used as a hash partner for the original leaf at that level. This duplication ensures that the tree remains balanced and each node has two children.

3. **Recalculating Root Hash**: When duplicating a leaf, it affects the hashes all the way up to the root of the tree. After duplicating a leaf, the hashes along the path from the leaf to the root need to be recalculated to reflect the change in the tree structure.

4. **Maintaining Consistency**: Duplicating a leaf ensures consistency in the Merkle Tree structure and enables efficient verification of the integrity of data. Each leaf still represents the same original value, but the duplication facilitates proper tree balancing and hash computation.

In summary, duplicating a value in a Merkle Tree ensures that the tree remains balanced and maintains its integrity, even when additional leaves are added or removed. This duplication strategy is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and security properties of Merkle Trees.
